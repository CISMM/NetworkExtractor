   * Win32Package.txt: Added test of a simple one-liner for including
   VTK DLLs auto-magically. It copies over the VTK DLLs, but seems
   to overwrite the other files (like the main program executable)
   included in the package. Commented out for now.

   * CMake/: New directory for CMake files used to configure the
   CPack installation mechanism.

   * Win32Package.txt: New file that adds Windows-specific variables
   for the NSIS installer.
