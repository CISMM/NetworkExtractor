   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added vesselness filter. This includes
   the ability to set a fiber diameter parameter (scale
   of the image derivative operators). Added a method to
   invoke when progress in an ITK filter is made. This in
   turn can call a callback set from the client application,
   allowing a progress bar to be updated in the UI. Switched
   to using ITK ImageFileReader instead of my own wrapper that
   wasn't really needed. Added method to save a filtered image
   (e.g., the results of the vesselness filter).

   * DataModel.h: Removed dirty bit stuff because it doesn't
   really make sense to have it. Added filter for performing
   thinning on image intensity thresholds. Made sure
   GetSpacing and GetDimensions don't crash if image data
   hasn't been set.

   * CMakeLists.txt: Initial check-in.
   
   * DataModel.h,.cxx: New class that encapsulates all data
   and data-related processing. Model in the 
   model-view-controller paradigm.
