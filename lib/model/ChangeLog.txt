   * DataModel.h: Removed dirty bit stuff because it doesn't
   really make sense to have it. Added filter for performing
   thinning on image intensity thresholds. Made sure
   GetSpacing and GetDimensions don't crash if image data
   hasn't been set.

   * CMakeLists.txt: Initial check-in.
   
   * DataModel.h,.cxx: New class that encapsulates all data
   and data-related processing. Model in the 
   model-view-controller paradigm.
