   * itk/itkEigenVectors3DToJunctionnessMeasureImageFilter.h,.cxx: Added
   initial implementation of the filter. Basically a type of matched filter for
   source- or sink-like structures that have no directional sense (doesn't
   matter which way the head of the vector is oriented). This should be
   useful for identifying junction points.
   
   * itk/itkHessian3DEigenAnalysisImageFilter.cxx: Changed it so that
   only one eigen vector is stored instead of all three.

   * itk/itkEigenVectors3DToJunctionnessMeasureImageFilter.h,.cxx: New
   class implementing a fiber junction detector. Implementation is currently
   incomplete.

   * itk/itkEigenValues3DToVesselnessMeasureImageFilter.h,.cxx: 
   Made the class multithreaded. Turns out to be easy to do in ITK.
   Removed image allocation in the data generation method. The superclass
   takes care of this.
   
   * itk/itkHessian3DEigenAnalysisImageFilter.h,.cxx: Made this class
   multithreaded. Overrode superclass method AllocateOutputs so that the 
   right allocation takes place. The superclass implementation allocates
   memory for just the one declared output type. When you have outputs
   of different types, say a 3-tuple and a 9-tuple per pixel, you'll probably
   declare one of these as *the* output type. Thus for the 9-tuple output,
   the superclass AllocateOutputs allocates 3-tuples instead and Bad Things
   Happen.

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added source files.

   * itk/: Added itk subdirectory for ITK subclasses.

   * itkEigenValues3DToVesselnessMeasureImage.h, .cxx: New class to compute a 
   vesselness measure from an image of eigen values. The eigen value image is 
   assumed to come from itkHessian3DEigenAnalysisImageFilter. Replicates
   functionality in itkHessian3DToVesselnessMeasureImageFilter, but requires
   the eigen value image as input. This seems redundant, but I need a class
   that computes the eigen vectors for the junctionness computation
   (forthcoming), and no existing class does this. Instead of computing the 
   eigen values inside the existing itkHessian3DToVesselnessMeasureImageFilter 
   class and then computing the eigen vectors again for the junctionness measure,
   I want to calculate the eigen values and vectors just once and then feed them
   into subsequent filters that compute vesselness and junctionness.
   
   * itkHessian3DEigenAnalysisImageFilter.h, .cxx: Computes eigen values
   (curvatures) and eigen vectors (principal directions of curvature) from an
   input Hessian image.

   * Initial check-in of source files.
