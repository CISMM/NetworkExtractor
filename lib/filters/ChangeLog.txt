   * CMakeLists.txt: Added source files.

   * itk/: Added itk subdirectory for ITK subclasses.

   * itkEigenValues3DToVesselnessMeasureImage.h, .cxx: New class to compute a 
   vesselness measure from an image of eigen values. The eigen value image is 
   assumed to come from itkHessian3DEigenAnalysisImageFilter. Replicates
   functionality in itkHessian3DToVesselnessMeasureImageFilter, but requires
   the eigen value image as input. This seems redundant, but I need a class
   that computes the eigen vectors for the junctionness computation
   (forthcoming), and no existing class does this. Instead of computing the 
   eigen values inside the existing itkHessian3DToVesselnessMeasureImageFilter 
   class and then computing the eigen vectors again for the junctionness measure,
   I want to calculate the eigen values and vectors just once and then feed them
   into subsequent filters that compute vesselness and junctionness.
   
   * itkHessian3DEigenAnalysisImageFilter.h, .cxx: Computes eigen values
   (curvatures) and eigen vectors (principal directions of curvature) from an
   input Hessian image.
