2009-07-27  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added Visualization.cxx source file.

   * Visualization.h,.cxx: Moved to here from application directory.

2009-06-26  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * IsosurfaceVisualizationPipeline.cxx: Now defaults to using
   display list instead of immediate mode rendering. Removed circular
   pipeline connection.

   * VisualizationPipeline.h: Formatting change.

2009-06-25  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * ImagePlaneVisualizationPipeline.cxx: Added call to Update() in the
   vtkImageShiftScale algorithm in method SetInputConnection().
   
   * IsosurfaceVisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: Added getters for visibility
   and fast rendering mode.
   
   * OutlineVisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: Added getter for visibility.

2009-06-23  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * ImagePlaneVisualizationPipeline.h, IsosurfaceVisualizationPipeline.h,
   OutlineVisualizationPipeline.h, VisualizationPipeline.h: Added newline 
   at end of file and move comments from after #endif to above to make gcc 
   happy.

2009-06-17  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * ImagePlaneVisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: Added method GetVisible().
   
   * IsosurfaceVisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: Added image clipping in the
   pipeline prior to isosurfacing. This makes inspection of the fiberness
   filter results easier by removing parts of the isosurface far from the 
   image plane so that we can see how the isosurface intersects the image
   plane.

2009-06-10  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * ImagePlaneVisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: Added methods for
   enabling/disabling auto-rescaling of image intensities, and implemented
   auto-rescaling.
   
   * IsosurfaceVisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: Marked the vtkContourFilter
   as modified so that the isosurface is updated when it is added to
   the renderer.
   
   * VisualizationPipeline.cxx: Added call to Update() on the input 
   algorithm to ensure the visualization is updated.

2009-06-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added source files for ImagePlaneVisualization
   class.
   
   * ImagePlaneVisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: New pipeline for
   visualizing the image data as z-slices.
   
   * IsosurfaceVisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: Added methods for
   setting visibility and color of isosurface.

2009-03-15  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * IsosurfaceVisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: Added method to
   fetch vtkPolyData from the isosurface. Added FastRenderingOn/Off
   methods to deal with very large isosurfaces.

2009-03-11  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added source files.
   
   * OutlineVisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: New pipeline generating
   an outline around a dataset.
   
   * VisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: Added member variable pointing
   to the input data. Added method GetInputConnection.

2009-03-11  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Initial check-in.
   
   * IsosurfaceVisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: Pipeline for rendering
   isosurfaces from image data.
   
   * VisualizationPipeline.h,.cxx: Base class for visualizatiion
   pipelines.
