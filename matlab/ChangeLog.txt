	* lineOrientationResponse.m: New function for calculating the response
	of a line filter as it rotates about a range of angles.
	
	* optimizeJunctions.m: New function that will verify intersections in
	images of fibrin networks and optimize their positions. Returns the 
	verified junction positions and the cardinality of the junction.
	
	* orientedGaussianLine.m: New function that computes an image of a 
	Gaussian line tilted by an angle about the axis normal to the image plane. 
	The anchor point of the line is always centered within the center pixel 
	of the generated image.
	
	* skeletonize.m: Script for computing the skeletonization of 2D fibrin
	network images.

    * findSkeletonJunctions.m: Finds junctions via template matching in a
    3x3 neighborhood surrounding a pixel on a skeleton.
    
    * rightRotate.m: Rotates a matrix 90 degrees to the right. Useful for 
    rotating template images, for example.

    * skeletonize.m: Script to load in 2D fibrin image, calculate curvatures,
	 mask according to curvature, skeletonize mask, and identify junctions.

    * fibrinGUI.m, .fig: Fixed a bug where principal direction arrows were
    being drawn on the histogram axes instead of the image axes. Added menu
    option to export image masks created by thresholding an image above and
    below a minimum and maximum value, respectively.

    * removeSmallIslands.m: Cleans up a binary image by removing connected
    components consisting of fewer than n pixels.

    * shapePlusCurvedness.m: Junction finding method that looks for pixels
    with curvedness greater than 4 and shape index 0.1 of -0.5, the shape
    index of a light-on-dark cylinder. Works terribly.

    * shapePlusK2.m: Junction finding method that looks for pixels with
    shape index greater than a minimum threshold and shape index quite
    different from the shape index of a cylinder. Also works terribly.

   * Initial check-in of all files used in the FibrinAnalysis MATLAB
   test-bed.
