    * fibrinGUI.m, .fig: Fixed a bug where principal direction arrows were
    being drawn on the histogram axes instead of the image axes. Added menu
    option to export image masks created by thresholding an image above and
    below a minimum and maximum value, respectively.

    * removeSmallIslands.m: Cleans up a binary image by removing connected
    components consisting of fewer than n pixels.

    * shapePlusCurvedness.m: Junction finding method that looks for pixels
    with curvedness greater than 4 and shape index 0.1 of -0.5, the shape
    index of a light-on-dark cylinder. Works terribly.

    * shapePlusK2.m: Junction finding method that looks for pixels with
    shape index greater than a minimum threshold and shape index quite
    different from the shape index of a cylinder. Also works terribly.

   * Initial check-in of all files used in the FibrinAnalysis MATLAB
   test-bed.
