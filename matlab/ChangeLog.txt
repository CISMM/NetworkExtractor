    * shapePlusCurvedness.m: Junction finding method that looks for pixels
    with curvedness greater than 4 and shape index 0.1 of -0.5, the shape
    index of a light-on-dark cylinder. Works terribly.

    * shapePlusK2.m: Junction finding method that looks for pixels with
    shape index greater than a minimum threshold and shape index quite
    different from the shape index of a cylinder. Also works terribly.
