2009-06-17  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Added method to save fiber orientations to a
   file. Added some more error checking on values in text boxes in the
   GUI. Added handler for new image cropping checkbox.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Added lots of tool tips. Added widgets to turn
   image cropping on/off and to set how many planes above and below
   the image plane should be fed into the isosurface filter.
   
   * Visualization.h,.cxx: Added some glue methods between GUI and
   the visualization pipelines.

2009-06-15  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added Windows resource file that sets the program
   icon.

2009-06-15  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Removed MACOSX_BUNDLE option from ADD_EXECUTABLE
   because it interferes with the Bundle generator of CPack. Now includes
   a top-level CMakeLists.txt file from the installer directory.
   
2009-06-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added commands for getting packaging with CPack
   mechanism to work.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx,.ui: Added some methods to convert between integral
   slider positions and floating point isosurface values and vice versa
   to get float slider behavior (will someday replace with David Feng's
   float slider). Added message dialog to confirm that user wants to
   close the program. Added ticks to sliders. Turned on editting of image
   data properties table and added method to handle those changes.

2009-06-10  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.cxx: Turned off some of the experimental junction finding
   image filters for now. Added skeletonization filter. Added support for
   new methods in the Visualization class that enable viewing the original
   image data in the slice plane and the filtered data as an isosurface.
   Added message box that asks for confirmation that user wanted to quit.
   Added toggling of widgets for setting the fiberness threshold. Did
   some variable renaming for greater consistency. Added reading/writing
   of new fiberness threshold widget.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Added widgets for setting fiberness threshold. Moved
   vertical spacers to make resizing of the various docks nicer. Added
   keyboard shortcuts for menu items.
   
   * Visualization.h: Changed so that now there are two methods for setting
   image data, one for the original input data, and one for the filtered
   data. Right now, the original data is shown in a slice viewer and the
   filtered data is shown as an isosurface. In the future, we could take
   an arbitrary number of inputs and a property describing which visualization
   mode to use.

2009-06-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Changed name of the app to FibrinAnalysis from
   FibrinAnalysisQt.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.h, .cxx: Added automatic saving of window size/position/visibility
   settings between application launches. Put .TIF files in front of the
   file-type list. Added a render call right after an image is loaded.
   Added event handling for checkboxes that control visibility of isosurface
   and image plane. Added event handling for image plane z-slice slider.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Added slider and text field for setting image z-slice
   to show. Added checkboxes for toggling visibility of isosurface and
   z-slice.
   
   * Visualization.h,.cxx: Added instance of image plane visualization.

2009-06-01  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Minor formatting changes.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Added method for handling GUI changes to the
   image filter drop-down menu (only parameters relevant to the currently
   selected image filter are now shown). Did this by splitting up GUI
   form elements into individual frames that can be shown or hidden at
   will with one line of code. Now saving a filtered image file reads a
   scale factor from the GUI.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Added separate image information dock widget.
   Split up image filter settings widgets into different frames to
   enable hiding/showing the appropriate widgets when the image filter
   is changed. Added "Window" menu to show/hide dock widgets. Added
   widgets to take image intensity scaling factor.

2009-05-22  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Added scroll bars to controls panels. Separated
   out buttons for calculating certain metrics to a separate dock.

2009-05-22  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.cxx,.ui: Added widgets to set Frangi vesselness
   filter coefficients and the glue between the widgets and the ITK
   filter.

2009-05-21  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx,.ui: Added option to compute threshold
   fiberness measure. Added GUI widgets to set fiberness threshold.
   Added a new section with widgets for computing certain metrics
   as a function of z.

2009-05-13  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Changed names of slots that respond to GUI
   events so that Qt's moc performs the connection from widget to
   slot automatically, that is, no explicit connect() function
   call is needed.

2009-05-13  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.cxx: Changed "vesselness" -> "fiberness".
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Changed "vesselness" -> "fiberness". Removed
   volume rendering option in display popup menu because the option
   isn't implemented.

2009-04-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx,.ui: Added filter type for finding the local
   junctionness maxima. Added widgets for setting junction spherical
   probe radius and vesselness threshold used in the junctionness
   computation.

2009-03-30  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Added DataModelType typedef for
   convenience. Moved filter names from here to DataModel.h.

2009-03-22  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Made the GUI aware of the junctionness
   filter. Progress callback now takes a message to show so I can
   see what filter is executing. Added ability to load stacks from
   3D TIFs (ITK magically supports this, too).
   
   * Visualization.cxx: Added check in SetInputConnection to avoid
   perturbing the visualization pipeline if the input to the 
   isosurface is the same as the current input.

2009-03-15  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx,.ui: Added menu command handlers for saving
   filtered image data, saving a snapshot of the render window,
   saving an animation of the current scene rotating 360 degrees, 
   saving the isosurface geometry in .vtk format, and resetting the
   default view. Added a progress callback to update the progress 
   bar in the GUI. Added support for loading LSM images (ITK
   supports this!). Added handling of checkbox that tells whether
   fast rendering should be used (display lists).
   
   * Visualization.h,.cxx: Added methods for retrieving the isosurface
   poly data and setting fast/slow rendering. 

2009-03-11  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added source for Visualization class. Added
   faVisualization library dependency.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Added handlers for new GUI widgets. Moved
   the visualization-specific stuff from here to the Visualization
   class. Lots of changes to handle updated GUI elements. Improved
   separation of initialization, event handling, and updating of
   the GUI.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Replaced separate text entry fields displaying
   info about the image with a single table of properties.
   
   * Visualization.h,.cxx: New class for handling all VTK-related
   visualization stuff.

2009-03-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added faIO and faFilters library dependencies.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.h, .cxx: Added support for loading VTK image files
   and creating isosurfaces from them.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Added widgets for displaying image information
   and for changing the isovalue.

2009-03-06  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Initial checking of source files with a simple GUI
   and simple geometry displayed in the VTK widget.
