   * CMakeLists.txt: Changed name of the app to FibrinAnalysis from
   FibrinAnalysisQt.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.h, .cxx: Added automatic saving of window size/position/visibility
   settings between application launches. Put .TIF files in front of the
   file-type list. Added a render call right after an image is loaded.
   Added event handling for checkboxes that control visibility of isosurface
   and image plane. Added event handling for image plane z-slice slider.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Added slider and text field for setting image z-slice
   to show. Added checkboxes for toggling visibility of isosurface and
   z-slice.
   
   * Visualization.h,.cxx: Added instance of image plane visualization.

2009-06-01  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Minor formatting changes.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Added method for handling GUI changes to the
   image filter drop-down menu (only parameters relevant to the currently
   selected image filter are now shown). Did this by splitting up GUI
   form elements into individual frames that can be shown or hidden at
   will with one line of code. Now saving a filtered image file reads a
   scale factor from the GUI.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Added separate image information dock widget.
   Split up image filter settings widgets into different frames to
   enable hiding/showing the appropriate widgets when the image filter
   is changed. Added "Window" menu to show/hide dock widgets. Added
   widgets to take image intensity scaling factor.

   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Added scroll bars to controls panels. Separated
   out buttons for calculating certain metrics to a separate dock.

2009-05-22  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.cxx,.ui: Added widgets to set Frangi vesselness
   filter coefficients and the glue between the widgets and the ITK
   filter.

2009-05-21  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx,.ui: Added option to compute threshold
   fiberness measure. Added GUI widgets to set fiberness threshold.
   Added a new section with widgets for computing certain metrics
   as a function of z.

2009-05-13  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Changed names of slots that respond to GUI
   events so that Qt's moc performs the connection from widget to
   slot automatically, that is, no explicit connect() function
   call is needed.

2009-05-13  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.cxx: Changed "vesselness" -> "fiberness".
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Changed "vesselness" -> "fiberness". Removed
   volume rendering option in display popup menu because the option
   isn't implemented.

2009-04-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx,.ui: Added filter type for finding the local
   junctionness maxima. Added widgets for setting junction spherical
   probe radius and vesselness threshold used in the junctionness
   computation.

2009-03-30  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Added DataModelType typedef for
   convenience. Moved filter names from here to DataModel.h.

2009-03-22  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Made the GUI aware of the junctionness
   filter. Progress callback now takes a message to show so I can
   see what filter is executing. Added ability to load stacks from
   3D TIFs (ITK magically supports this, too).
   
   * Visualization.cxx: Added check in SetInputConnection to avoid
   perturbing the visualization pipeline if the input to the 
   isosurface is the same as the current input.

2009-03-15  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx,.ui: Added menu command handlers for saving
   filtered image data, saving a snapshot of the render window,
   saving an animation of the current scene rotating 360 degrees, 
   saving the isosurface geometry in .vtk format, and resetting the
   default view. Added a progress callback to update the progress 
   bar in the GUI. Added support for loading LSM images (ITK
   supports this!). Added handling of checkbox that tells whether
   fast rendering should be used (display lists).
   
   * Visualization.h,.cxx: Added methods for retrieving the isosurface
   poly data and setting fast/slow rendering. 

2009-03-11  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added source for Visualization class. Added
   faVisualization library dependency.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Added handlers for new GUI widgets. Moved
   the visualization-specific stuff from here to the Visualization
   class. Lots of changes to handle updated GUI elements. Improved
   separation of initialization, event handling, and updating of
   the GUI.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Replaced separate text entry fields displaying
   info about the image with a single table of properties.
   
   * Visualization.h,.cxx: New class for handling all VTK-related
   visualization stuff.

2009-03-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added faIO and faFilters library dependencies.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.h, .cxx: Added support for loading VTK image files
   and creating isosurfaces from them.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Added widgets for displaying image information
   and for changing the isovalue.

2009-03-06  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Initial checking of source files with a simple GUI
   and simple geometry displayed in the VTK widget.
