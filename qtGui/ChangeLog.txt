   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx,.ui: Added menu command handlers for saving
   filtered image data, saving a snapshot of the render window,
   saving an animation of the current scene rotating 360 degrees, 
   saving the isosurface geometry in .vtk format, and resetting the
   default view. Added a progress callback to update the progress 
   bar in the GUI. Added support for loading LSM images (ITK
   supports this!). Added handling of checkbox that tells whether
   fast rendering should be used (display lists).
   
   * Visualization.h,.cxx: Added methods for retrieving the isosurface
   poly data and setting fast/slow rendering.

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added source for Visualization class. Added
   faVisualization library dependency.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.h,.cxx: Added handlers for new GUI widgets. Moved
   the visualization-specific stuff from here to the Visualization

   separation of initialization, event handling, and updating of
   the GUI.
   
   * FibrinAppQt.ui: Replaced separate text entry fields displaying
   info about the image with a single table of properties.
