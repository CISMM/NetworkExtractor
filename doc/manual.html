<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Fibrin Analysis is a program developed to analyze images of fibrous objects, 
specifically targeting confocal microscopy images of fibrin networks. The
program has filters for segmenting fibrous objects and computing their approximate
centerlines. In addition, the orientation of fibers running through centerline voxels
can be estimated and exported to a spreadsheet file for further analysis.

The program window after startup.
</span>

The program window is shown on the right. At
the top of the window is a standard menu bar. Below the menu
bar is the <em>Visualization panel</em> for viewing image data
and segmentation results. Rotating, translating, and scaling the
visualization interactively is done by clicking and dragging the mouse 
within this panel. Four docked windows on the left-hand
side of the window contain control panels for interacting with the
program. The <em>Image Analysis</em> window contains a control panel
for changing settings for the image analysis algorithms. The <em>Display</em>
window contains controls for changing the visualization of the image data.
The <em>Tasks</em> window contains buttons for performing various
analysis tasks. Finally, the <em>Image Information</em> window 
displays information about the image and enables changing of certain settings
such as image pixel size. These windows can be undocked from the main 
program window by clicking and dragging in the window's title bar.</p>

<h2><a name="menubar"></a>Menu Bar</h2>

<p>The menu bar in Fibrin Analysis contains three menus that
provide commands useful to creating loading data, saving results,
modifying the viewpoint of the visualization, and controlling visibility
of the control panel windows. Each menu is described in more detail below.</p>

<h3>File Menu</h3>

<p>
<!-- <span class="figure narrow">
<img src="images/file_menu.png" width="135" height="162" alt="File Menu"/><br/>
The File menu.
</span> -->

The File Menu features typical options for creating and saving
simulations:</p>

<dl>
  
  <dt>Open Image...</dt> <dd>Opens an image file. Supported file
  formats are: multi-layer TIF, VTK, and LSM. The 
  <a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/imagej">LOCI Bio-Formats plug-in</a>
  for <a href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>
  can be used to convert many microscopy file formats into TIF files.
  Series of TIF images defining a 3D image cannot currently
  be opened.</dd>

  <dt>Save Filtered Image...</dt> <dd>Saves the result of the
  currently selected image filter in the <em>Filter Settings</em> control
  panel in the <em>Image Analysis</em> window as a 16-bit TIF file.
  Use the <em>Filtered image intensity scale</em> setting in the
  <em>Image Analysis</em> window to adjust the filtered image intensities
  to the range [0,65535], the valid range for 16-bit TIF images.</dd>

  <dt>Save Fiber Orientation Data...</dt> <dd>Saves a vector image
  containing the estimated fiber orientation at each pixel in the image.
  The number of slices (z-dimension of the image) may be larger than
  the input image if the <em>Z slice spacing</em> is different from the
  <em>X dimension (pixels)</em> or <em>Y dimension (pixels)</em>. In that
  case, the image will be resampled to produce isotropic voxels. This
  reduces directional bias in fiber orientation statistics.</dd>

  <dt>Open Session...</dt> <dd>Opens a session file that contains
  control panel settings. If an image was open when the session file
  was saved, then this menu item will open that same image.</dd>

  <dt>Save Session...</dt> <dd>Saves a session file that contains
  control panel settings.</dd>
  
  <dt>Save Picture...</dt> <dd>Saves a screen shot of the visualization
  panel.</dd>
  
  <dt>Save Rotation Animation...</dt> <dd>Saves a series of PNG files
  that constitutes a rotating animation of the items in the visualization
  panel.</dd>
  
  <dt>Save Geometry...</dt> <dd>Saves a VTK file that contains the
  geometry of an isosurface from a filtered version of the loaded
  image. The filter is the one selected in the <em>Filter Settings</em> control
  panel in the <em>Image Analysis</em> window. The isovalue is the one
  in the <em>Display Settings</em> control panel in the <em>Display</em>
  window. </dd>
  
  <dt>Exit</dt> <dd>Exit the program.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>View Menu</h3>

<p>
<!-- <span class="figure narrow">
<img src="images/model_menu.png" alt="Model Menu"/><br/>
The Model menu.
</span> -->

The model menu has options for adding and removing geometric models to
the simulation.</p>

<dl>

  <dt>Open View...</dt> <dd>Opens a file specifying camera settings
  for the visualization panel.</dd>

  <dt>Save View...</dt> <dd>Saves a file with the current settings
  of the camera in the visualization panel.</dd>

  <dt>Reset View</dt> <dd>Resets the camera so that the image is
  centered and scaled to fit in the panel and looking down the
  negative z-axis.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Window Menu</h3>

<p>
<!-- <span class="figure narrow">
<img src="images/window_menu.png" alt="Window Menu"/><br/>
The Window menu.
</span> -->

The Window menu primarily controls visibility of windows in the program:</p>

<dl>

  <dt>About Fibrin Analysis</dt> <dd>Shows a window containing information about
  the program.</dd>

  <dt>Image Analysis Window</dt> <dd>Toggle the visibility of the <em>Image Analysis</em> window.</dd>

  <dt>Display Window</dt> <dd>Toggle the visibility of the <em>Display</em> window.</dd>
  
  <dt>Tasks Window</dt> <dd>Toggle the visibility of the <em>Tasks</em> window.</dd>
  
  <dt>Image Information Window</dt> <dd>Toggle the visibility of the <em>Image Information</em> window.</dd>

</dl>

<h3><a name="visualization_panel"></a>Visualization Panel</h3>

<p>Clicking and dragging within the <em>Visualization Panel</em> causes 
manipulation of the camera. You can change the
view of the specimen models by rotating, translating, and zooming in
on the scene. Clicking and dragging while holding various mouse
buttons enacts these camera transformations:

<ul>

  <li><strong>Left mouse button</strong> - Causes rotation of the scene</li>

  <li><strong>Middle mouse button</strong> - Causes translation of the scene</li>

  <li><strong>Right mouse button</strong> - Causes zooming in on the scene</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="image_analysis_window"></a>Image Analysis Window</h3>

<p>
<span class="figure">
<img src="images/image_analysis_window.png" width="320" alt="Image Analysis Window"/><br/>
The Image Analysis Window.
</span>

The <em>Image Analysis Window</em> controls which filter is applied to the image. The available filters,
explained below, are connected in a pipeline. That is, the result of a filter in the list is
fed into the subsequent filter. You can switch between filters to examine results at intermediate
steps of the full image analysis pipeline in the visualization panel. The filter results are
displayed only as an isosurface; the raw image data is displayed in the image plane. For example, switching to the 
<em>Multiscale Fiberness</em> filter will display the filter results via the isosurface in the
display window. You can then adjust filter parameters based on how well the isosurface
appears to account for fibrous objects in the image.<br /> <br />

In addition to determining what the isosurface shows, the selected filter also specifies which data is saved 
when the <em>Save Filtered Image...</em> menu item is chosen in the <em>File</em> menu.</p>

<p>
Each filter in the <em>Image Filter</em> list depends on all of the filters above it. To minimize
clutter in the interface, only the settings for the selected filter and those that it depends on
are displayed. Each filter and its settings are explained below.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>No filter</dt> <dd><p>No filter is applied to the image. The raw image data is displayed in the
visualization panel.</p>
<ul>

<li><em>Filtered image intensity scale</em> - This value is a scale factor applied to 
the output of the selected filter -- not just the raw image data --. It is typically
used to scale the range of the image data to the range [0, 65535], the range of
values representable by 16-bit TIF files.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Multiscale Fiberness</dt> <dd>

</dd>

<dt>Multiscale Fiberness Threshold</dt> <dd><p>This filter creates a binary image
(one whose voxel values are restricted to 0 and 1) from the result of the multiscale
fiberness filter. All voxels with values above the threshold are set to 1 and all
the others are set to 0.</p>

<ul>

<li><em>Fiberness threshold</em> - The threshold value. One stategy to determine
this value is to adjust the isovalue in the <em>Display Window</em> so that the
isosurface overlaps fibrous objects in the image adequately. Setting the threshold
value to this isovalue will ensure that the statistics are taken on all fibrous objects 
in the image.</li>

</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Skeletonization</dt> <dd><p>Roughly speaking, skeletonization is a 
process of repeatedly removing voxels from a set of connected voxels until 
a thin "curve" one voxel wide is left. For a fibrous object, the resulting 
set of voxels, called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_skeleton">
topological skeleton</a>, approximates the medial axis of the object.
A medial axis is also sometimes called a centerline. There are no
settings for this filter.</p>

<p>The algorithm used by this filter is from T.C. Lee, R.L. Kashyap, and C.N. Chu.
Building skeleton models via 3-D medial surface/axis thinning algorithms. Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing, 56(6):462--478, 1994.
The ITK filter implementation was written by Hanno Homann, Oxford University, Wolfson Medical Vision Lab, UK 
and is available from the <a href="http://www.insight-journal.org/browse/publication/181">Insight Journal</a>.</p></dd>

centered about the slice displayed in the image plane. Turning this on can be useful
for comparing the raw image data to the isosurface showing the filter results. </dd>

<dt>Keep Planes Above/Below</dt> <dd>Specifies the number of image slices on each
side of the slice displayed by the image plane through which the isosurface will be
taken. The slab of slices defined by this setting is bounded by the boundaries of
the image.</dd>

The Tasks Window.
</span>

This window provides controls for carrying out certain analysis tasks in the program.<br /><br />
The <em>Fiber Angle Histogram</em> task saves statistics of the fiber orientations. The histogram
is of angles formed between a reference direction and the orientation of voxel-sized segments along
fibers. Orientations of fiber segments are specified by 3D vectors. The program considers a vector <em>v</em> and
<em>-v</em> to have equivalent orientations. All orientation vectors are processed so that they point in a
set of directions defining a hemisphere. The hemisphere is defined by the plane orthogonal to the reference
direction. The re-orientation process ensures that angles between a fiber segment and the reference direction are
in the range [0, 90] degrees.<br /> <br />

The reference direction is specified by the <em>Azimuth</em> and <em>Inclination</em>, defined below.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Azimuth</dt> <dd>The azimuth, specified in degrees, controls the spin angle about the z-axis.
A setting of 0 degrees, aligns the reference direction with the x-axis. If you select the 
<em>View</em>-&gt;<em>Reset View</em> option, the arrow will point to the right on the screen.
A setting of 90 degrees will point the reference direction up on the screen.</dd>

<dt>Inclination</dt> <dd>The inclination, also specified in degrees, controls the angle between
the reference direction and the xy-plane. If you select the <em>View</em>-&gt;<em>Reset View</em> option,
this setting moves the tip of the reference direction above or below the screen plane. A positive
value lifts the tip up in the z-direction while a negative value pushes it down.</dd>

<dt>Show Direction Arrow</dt> <dd>Toggle the visibility of an arrow showing the reference direction.</dd>

<dt>Histogram Bins</dt> <dd>Controls the number of bins in the angle histogram. </dd>

</dl>

<p>The angle histogram can be saved by clicking the <em>Save Angle Histogram</em> button. The file
saved by this action is a comma-separated file that can be opened in popular spreadsheet software.
This spreadsheet contains several columns of data, described below.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Angle (deg.)</dt> <dd>The minimum value in the histogram bin. The maximum value in the histogram bin is given by the next row in this column.
The maximum angle on the last bin is 90 degrees.</dd>

<dt>Count</dt> <dd>The number of image voxels in the histogram bin.</dd>

<dt>Normalized Count</dt> <dd>The number of image voxels in the histogram bin divided by the total number of voxel values in the histogram.</dd>

<dt>Expected Probability</dt> <dd>The expected normalized histogram value for an object with uniform randomly distributed orientation of fiber segments.</dd>

<dt>Over-representation Ratio</dt> <dd>The normalized count divided by the expected probability. This gives an indication of whether and to what
degree the orientations within a histogram bin are overrepresented. A value of 1.0 means the number of orientations of fiber segments falling
into this bin is expected, a value below 1.0 means there are fewer fiber segments
falling in this bin than expected, and a value above 1.0 means there are more fiber segments falling into the bin than expected
for an object with uniform randomly distributed orientations.</dd>

four settings are editable while the others are not.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Intensity minimum</dt> <dd>Minimum intensity value in the filtered image.</dd>

<dt>Intensity maximum</dt> <dd>Maximum intensity value in the filtered image.</dd>

<dt>X dimension (pixels)</dt> <dd>Dimension of image in the x-direction (how many pixels).</dd>

<dt>Y dimension (pixels)</dt> <dd>Dimension of image in the y-direction (how many pixels).</dd>

<dt>Z dimension (slices)</dt> <dd>Dimension of image in the z-direction (how many slices).</dd>

<dt>X pixel size (&mu;m)</dt> <dd>The size of the pixel, or spacing between pixels, in the x-direction (voxel x-spacing). <em>Editable</em></dd>

<dt>Y pixel size (&mu;m)</dt> <dd>The size of the pixel, or spacing between pixels, in the y-direction (voxel y-spacing). <em>Editable</em></dd>

<dt>Z slice spacing (&mu;m)</dt> <dd>The spacing between slices in the image (voxel z-spacing). <em>Editable</em></dd>

<dt>Z squish factor</dt> <dd>This value specifies a scale factor for the z-spacing of the image that is not the same as the
Z slice spacing. The squish factor is meant as a way to correct for the apparent elongation of objects in the z-direction
in images from confocal microscopes. This elongation is an artifact caused by the point-spread function of the microscope.
Setting the Z squish factor to a value below 1.0 will compress the image in the z-dimension, essentially undoing the elongation caused
by the point-spread function. For confocal microscopes, a Z squish factor of 0.5 works well. <em>Editable</em>

and <em>Display</em> windows.</p>
